  These setter methods were incorrectly treated as public, but they are actually protected.
  Getters are public and generator used to ignore mismatching visibility.
  
  Unfortunately, there is no way to define "partial" properties and we cannot
  manually add setter-only properties in other sources.
  So far the only way to fix it is, to fake API and treat them as public.
  
  Note that this is only for API compatibility and usually people should not follow this sort of hacks!
